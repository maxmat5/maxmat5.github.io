        This is the web page all about me! This will be all about me and my experiences and some pictures as well. 
        Hi, My name is Maximus Matarese. I am a undergraduate student at The University of Rhode Island. 
        I am currently studying Computer Engineering with a interest in a minor of Computer Science. 
        I am from the small town of North Providence, Rhode Island. I love video games. My favorite is Halo.
        I could talk about that game for hours to anyone who asks. I also love sports including baseball and basketball. 
        I played baseball since I was very little and was pretty good. I also started playing basketabll at a young age. 
        I still play these sports today when I can. I'm so excited to be learning how to code. It feels very good to be starting this jorney. 
        I can't wait to learn the other challenging prgramming languages and create even better projects like games and even cooler websites.
        That's just a little about me. I can't wait to fill this web page with even more. Thank you for reading!
