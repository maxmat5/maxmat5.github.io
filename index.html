      <br>  <p> Hello everyone, this is my first webpage and my programming portfolio for my CSC 106 Course at The University of Rhode Island
        Thank you so much for viewing, Enjoy. This stuff is awesome and I'm so excited to learn. This website is all about my journey and some of my projects in my first course 
        of computer science. The home page is tradionally a place where you see it all. There will be very basic stuff on this homepage like the navigation buttions
        to different parts of the site. The About Me page will be all about me and my personal stories and my personal life. While the javascripts page will contain some of my 
        first javascript codes and my experiences with learning javascript. I hope you get to like my first website! Thank you so much! 
        </p>
