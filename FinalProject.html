      Hi everyone! This is my final project for CSC 106. Flappy Bit is a game based on the original: Flappy Bird. 
      Flappy Bit is an interactive game that has you use the space bar as the "jump" key and fly the character through the tubes to score points. 
      When first starting the game, the character will be seen and the tubes will start flowing from right to left.You must jump through the opening in the tubes to score points.
      If in the event you suck and hit the tubes the game will be over and you will be prompted to try again.  See what your high score is!
      This game was a lot of fun making with my friend Andrew. We worked very hard on it and tried our best to fix out the bugs when they arose. Other then all the little bugs, we think it came out very well and we are very proud of the work we put into it. 
      Good luck and have fun!
